# ML_Basics
Built a complete end-to-end regression pipeline to predict housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset.
Implemented data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation (log scaling of target).
Used Scikit-learn’s Pipeline and ColumnTransformer for automated preprocessing of numerical and categorical features.
Compared Ridge Regression (RMSE ≈ 0.1188) and Random Forest Regressor (RMSE ≈ 0.1222).
Analyzed feature importances — OverallQual, GrLivArea, and GarageCars were top predictors of price.
Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
